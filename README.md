This project is built with create-react-app cli, and already webpack configured.

All functionalities required in the pdf document are **fully done**.

One more thing to add is that it's fully **responsive** in both **desktop** and **mobile**.

## How to Run the project.

npm install

npm start

It runs on localhost:3000
